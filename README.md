# Face_Recognition_System
Developed a cutting-edge face recognition system, providing state-of-the-art capabilities for identity verification and access control.
**Project Overall Summary**
This project presents the development and implementation of a real-time face
recognition system utilizing computer vision techniques. The system is designed to
detect and identify known individuals in **live video streams**, offering applications in
security, surveillance, and user experience enhancement.
The project employs the Python programming language along with the “OpenCV “and
“face_recognition libraries “ to create a functional face recognition . The system is
trained on a collection of known faces, including prominent personalities such as
"DR_YASIR_ARAFAT_MALKANI," "QUAID_E_AZAM," "BILL_GATES," and
"MS_NIRMA_ABRO." These known faces are encoded to generate reference encodings
for comparison.
**“The heart of the system lies in its ability to process real-time video frames captured
from a webcam. Upon capturing each frame”**, the system detects facial features,
computes face encodings, and compares them against the reference encodings of
known individuals. In cases of positive matches, the system labels the detected face
with the corresponding name and draws a bounding rectangle around it. If no match is
found, the system classifies the face as **"Unknown."**
During development, we faced challenges like handling different lighting and camera
angles, and dealing with image quality issues. The installation of the face recognition
library (dlib) was a major roadblock at first, causing face recognition problems.
However, after seeking help online, sharing errors with the community, and persistent
troubleshooting, we managed to solve the library installation issue. This effort led to a
successful enhancement of our face recognition system..
The face recognition system not only showcases practical implementation but also
highlights the significance of real-time capabilities in diverse fields. It enables efficient
identification and authentication, contributes to personalized user experiences, and
holds potential in retail, security, and interactive installations.
In conclusion, This python project provides developing a real-time face recognition system. By bridging
theoretical concepts with practical application, the project underscores the promising
possibilities of facial recognition technology in modern technological landscapes.
